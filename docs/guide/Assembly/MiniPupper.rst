0. Update change points after April 15 2022
============================================

* Updated the body and hip parts from 3D printed to mold.
* Re-designed and unified the original four hip parts into one for mold, for the detailed info, please refer to the mechanical design section.
* If you get your Mini Pupper kit after April 15 2022, it will be easier to assemble.
* If you have 3D printer and still hope to use the previous 3D printed design, that's OK.


1. Write the pre-built image into microSD
===========================================

Tools
---------
In addition to the tools included in the kit, the following items are required for assembly.

* USB keyboard
* USB mouse
* PC
* microSD card reader
* HDMI Display
* micro HDMI cable
* USB charger


Step 1.1 Charging the battery
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The battery is charged via USB, see picture for USB socket, and can also be charged while attached to the Mini Pupper body.

※ LED light: Green means there is enough power, and Red means you need to charge it.

※ We recommend 5V/1A adapter, if you use 5V/2A adapter, the battery IC will change it to 1A. It needs about 1 hour to charge 80% and the light will become green, and an additional 1 hour to 100%, anyway, you can use it when the light becomes green.

Step 1.2 Download the image
----------------------------------------------------------------

* You can download latest image file via the below folder.

	`Release.from.MangDang <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bGAlbOWVvBkjfKjbjd-UQpA1sOBoKit9?usp=sharing>`_


* The below picture is the custom carry board.

    :align: center

※ “xxx_MiniPupper_Controller_Ubuntu_22.04.img” means the image is for Ubuntu 22.04 version.

※ "xxx.MiniPupper_ROS&OpenCV_Ubuntu20.04.03.img" is the image file for the Ubuntu + ROS + OpenCV version for SLAM & Navigation & AI.


Step 1.3 Write the image into microSD card
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Insert the microSD card into your PC's SD card reader and write the image. We recommend the image creation tool balenaEtcher or Win32DiskImager as it is easy and reliable. It takes a while to complete.



* Remove the SD card from the PC and insert it into the Raspberry pi.

    </div>


Tools
------------
In addition to the tools included in the kit, the following items are required for assembly.

* Loctite

※ We don't recommand new users to use the Loctite at first, you can use it after you have much background.

※ Loctite prevents the nut from loosening, but it is not essential, as it can be tightened only when looseness is noticed.

Bolt to use
-------------------
* M2x5mm	2x4=8	①+②, ⑤+⑥
* M2x8mm	3x4=12	②+③, ④+⑦, ③+④
* M2x12mm	1x4=4	⑤+⑦
* M2x14mm	1x4=4	③+⑤

Step 3.1 Single leg
---------------------

* Assemble the four legs. The front and back of the right side are the same, and so are the front and back of the left side. Show you how to assemble the right side.

* Video Instructions, please refer to the link https://youtu.be/Ut7UnS3CTZs


* The parts are numbered as follows to explain.

.. image:: ../../_static/1.jpg
    :align: center


Assemble ① and ②

* Use one M2x5mm screw.The screw is inserted from the bottom of ② upwards and tightened by inserting them into the screw holes in ①. Be careful about the sides of ②.

* The two ballbearings in ② should be inserted all the way in and the end should be slightly visible as shown in the picture below. Tap the ball bearing and press it in without gaps.

----------------------

.. image:: ../../_static/36.jpg
    :align: center

Step 3.3 Locktite
--------------------

* As the nut is on a moving joint, it will loosen quickly if tightened too tightly. They should be secured with Loctite. It is possible to dismantle the nut later, as it can be loosened by a strong force.

.. image:: ../../_static/37.jpg
    :align: center

* Some screws are also secured with glue as the below picture shows.

    </div>


There are two kinds of servo cables, No.1,4,7,10 cables length is 9cm, other cables length is 15cm.

* For the position of each servos, please refer to the below picture.

.. image:: ../../_static/52.jpg
    :align: center

* Here shows how to assemble the rear right hip.

Confirm whether the servo shaft is at the right position.
The middle position marker is added on the output shaft, the output shaft is at its middle position by fault as the left picture shows. The shaft position may be changed during assembly as the middle picture shows, if you find it, you can use the servo horn to move the output shaft to the right position, and then finally make the servo horn at the place as the right picture shows.

.. image:: ../../_static/39.jpg
    :align: center

Connect the servo and hip part.

.. image:: ../../_static/40_1.jpg
