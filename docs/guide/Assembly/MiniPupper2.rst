  :depth: 2

There are two kinds of kits to assemble.

* Complete Kit: For those who are eager to understand every aspect of the mechanical details, this kit is for you. It requires a hands-on approach as you'll be assembling everything from scratch. Plan on spending at least 5 hours or more on this engaging DIY project.

* Standard Kit: If you're looking for a quicker start, the Standard Kit is the way to go. With the legs pre-assembled, you can have your project up and running in approximately one hour. It's designed for those who want to jump right in and start experiencing the fun without the extensive assembly time.


This is the video clip for the Standard kit, please refer to the section "Standard Kit Main Parts Assembly" for detailed steps.

1. Write the pre-built image into microSD
##########################################

Tools
---------------------------------------
In addition to the tools included in the kit, the following items are required for assembly.

* USB keyboard
* USB mouse
* PC
* microSD card reader
* HDMI Display
* micro HDMI cable
* USB charger


Step 1.1 Charging the battery
------------------------------

* The battery is charged via USB, see picture for USB socket, and can also be charged while attached to the Mini Pupper body.

※ LED light: Green means there is enough power, and Red means you need to charge it.

※ We recommend 5V/1A adapter, if you use 5V/2A adapter, the battery IC will change it to 1A. It needs about 1 hour to charge 80% and the light will become green, and an additional 1 hour to 100%, anyway, you can use it when the light becomes green.

Step 1.2 Download the image
-----------------------------

* You can download the pre-built image files from  `Mini Pupper pre-built images <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_HNbIb2RDmHpwECjqiVlkylvU19BSfOh?usp=sharing>`_

※ “xxx_stanford**.img” means the image is for Ubuntu 22.04 version.

* The picture below is the custom carry board.

Step 1.3 Write the image into a microSD card
---------------------------------------------

* Insert the microSD card into your PC's SD card reader and write the image. We recommend the image creation tool balenaEtcher or Win32DiskImager as it is easy and reliable. It may take a while to complete.


2. Position of the screws
###########################

* The pictures show the position of the screws briefly.

    </div>

Bolt to use
---------------------------------------
* M2x5mm	2x4=8	①+②, ⑤+⑥
* M2x8mm	3x4=12	②+③, ④+⑦, ③+④
* M2x12mm	1x4=4	⑤+⑦
* M2x14mm	1x4=4	③+⑤

Step 3.1 Single leg
---------------------------------------

* Assemble the four legs. The front and back of the right side are the same, and so are the front and back of the left side. Show you how to assemble the right side.

* Video Instructions, please refer to the link https://youtu.be/Ut7UnS3CTZs


* The parts are numbered as follows to explain.

.. image:: ../../_static/1.jpg

Assemble ① and ②

.. image:: ../../_static/2.v2.jpg

.. image:: ../../_static/6.v2.1.jpg
    :align: center

* The two sides of bearings inside ② are different.

.. image:: ../../_static/3.jpg
    :align: center

.. image:: ../../_static/6.v2.jpg
    :align: center

Assemble ② and ③

* Use an M2x8mm screw and an M2 locknut. Insert the screw from the bottom to the top of ③, pass through ② and tighten with the nut. It is important to pay attention to the orientation of ③. Look carefully at the position of the hole in the middle.

.. image:: ../../_static/7.v2.jpg
    :align: center

.. image:: ../../_static/8.v2.jpg
    :align: center


Adjustment of the length of ④

* The length of ④ must match the length of ⑤. When adjusting the length, it is easier to use two long screws to make sure that the lengths match. Once the lengths have been adjusted, take apart all.

.. image:: ../../_static/10.jpg

    :align: center

* If it's hard to twist, you can use two screwdrivers to assist.

.. image:: ../../_static/11_1.jpg
    :align: center


Assemble ⑤ and ⑥

* Use one M2x5mm screw. Insert the screws into ⑤ first, insert them into the holes of ⑥, and tighten them. The large hole in ⑥ should be facing the surface.

.. image:: ../../_static/14.jpg
    :align: center

Assemble ⑤ and ⑦

* Use an M2x12mm screw, an M2 locknut and two sets of ball bearings. Each ball bearing is made up of three parts, the top and bottom parts with the grooved side facing inwards. Insert a screw into a set of ball bearing. Then insert the screw into the hole ⑦. Taking care to look at the warped side of ⑦ to make sure it is facing the right way. Now screw in the another set of ball bearing. Finally, insert screw into ⑤ and tighten it with the nut.

Assemble ④ and ⑦

* Use an M2x8mm screw and an M2 nut. Insert the screw into ⑦ and put ④ through, then tighten it with the nut. The direction of the front and back of ④ can be either.

Left and right leg

.. image:: ../../_static/26.jpg
    :align: center

Assemble ③ and ⑤

* Use M2x14mm screws and two sets of ball bearings. Thread the screws through the bearings, ③, bearings, ⑤, in that order. The screws are not fixed, but you will tighten them when you mount the servo in the next step.

Completion of a right leg


* Now we have one leg on the right side. Here are some pictures so you can see it from different angles. The left leg should be symmetrical with the right one.

Step 3.2 Four legs
---------------------------------------

    :align: center

Step 3.3 Locktite
---------------------------------------

After Mini Pupper run sometime, some screws or nuts will loose, you have to check and tighten them if needed. It's helpful to understand how it works.

※ We don't recommend new users to use the Loctite at first, you can use it after you have much background.

※ Loctite prevents the nut from loosening, but it is not essential, as it can be tightened only when looseness is noticed.

* Some screws are also secured with glue as the below picture shows.

Step 5.1 Body center parts
---------------------------

Connect the No.1, 4, 7, 10 servos to the body center parts.

* It is useful to put masking tape on the cables and write the number of servos during this process to make it easier later.


.. image:: ../../_static/49.v2.1.jpg
    :align: center

* Pay attention to the center part direction.

.. image:: ../../_static/49.v2.2.jpg
