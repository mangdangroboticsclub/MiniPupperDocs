ROS2 Installation
######################


* Mini Pupper's ROS2 installation package is based on `ros2_setup_scripts <https://github.com/Tiryoh/ros2_setup_scripts_ubuntu>`_  which is written by one of our contributor @Tiryoh.
* Mini Pupper's ROS2 version is based on `Champ <https://github.com/chvmp/champ>`_  open source project, and we made some changes to SLAM and Navigation functions.
* Mini Pupper's software supporting lidar sensor is based on `ldlidar_stl_ros2 <https://github.com/ldrobotSensorTeam/ldlidar_stl_ros2>`_  open source project.

We recommend you explore Mini Pupper with ROS2 network, make sure your PC and Mini Pupper have connected to the same WiFi.

Through the following steps, you will be able to setup the ros2 for your remote PC and the Mini Pupper.

1. PC Setup
------------

PC Setup corresponds to PC (your desktop or laptop PC) for controlling Mini Pupper remotely. Do not apply these commands to your Mini Pupper.

**WARNING: The contents in this chapter corresponds to the Remote PC (your desktop or laptop PC) which will control Mini Pupper. Do not apply these commands to your Raspberry Pi on Mini Pupper or Compute Module 4 on Mini Pupper 2.**

SLAM
######################

The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technique to draw a map by estimating current location in an arbitrary space. Following the steps below, we can use Mini Pupper to draw a map of the surrounding area.

**NOTE: Please run the SLAM node on Remote PC.**
**Make sure to launch the Bringup from Mini Pupper before executing any operation.**

1. Run SLAM Node
------------

1. If Bringup is not launched on Mini Pupper, launch Bringup first.

::
	
	. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	ros2 launch mini_pupper_bringup bringup.launch.py

2. Open a new terminal from Remote PC with Ctrl + Alt + T and launch the SLAM node. 

::
	
	. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	ros2 launch mini_pupper_slam slam.launch.py

2. Teleoperation
------------

Following the steps below, we can use teleoperation to explore unknown area of the map.

**NOTE: Once SLAM node is successfully up and running. Vigorous change of the linear and angular speed might lower the smoothness of map generated.**
**WARNING: Make sure to run the Bringup from the Mini Pupper before teleoperation. Be careful when testing the robot on the table as the robot might fall during teleoperation.**

2.1 Keyboard
^^^^^^

After teleoperation, a map with unknown area revealed will be shown as followed:

.. image:: ../_static/Slam-map.jpg
    :align: center  

|

3. Save the map
------------

Following the steps below, the files of the map will be saved.

1. Open a terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T on remote PC.
2. Use the following command to launch the map_saver_cli node in the nav2_map_server package to create map files.

The map file is saved in the directory where the map_saver_cli node is launched at.

::

	. ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
	ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map 

After running the above command, two files will be generated, namely map.pgm and map.yaml.

Navigation
######################

Navigation allows the robot to move from one location to the specified destination based on the infomation of a map given from the IMU and the lidar sensor created from SLAM.

The following video shows how we can use the navigation function to make the Mini Pupper move along the planned path.
