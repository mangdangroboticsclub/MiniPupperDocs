1. Write the pre-built image into microSD
-------------------------------

Tools
^^^^^^
In addition to the tools included in the kit, the following items are required for assembly.

* USB keyboard
* USB mouse
* PC
* microSD card reader
* HDMI Display 
* micro HDMI cable
* USB charger


Step 1.1 Charging the battery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The battery is charged via USB, see picture for USB socket, and can also be charged while attached to the Mini Pupper body. 

※ LED light: Green means there is enough power, and Red means you need to charge it.

※ We recommend 5V/1A adapter, if you use 5V/2A adapter, the battery IC will change it to 1A. It needs about 1 hour to charge 80% and the light will become green, and an additional 1 hour to 100%, anyway, you can use it when the light becomes green.

Step 3.2 Four legs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../_static/36.v2.jpg
    :align: center

Step 3.3 Locktite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After Mini Pupper run sometime, some screws or nuts will loose, you have to check and tighten them if needed. It's helpful to understand how it works.

※ We don't recommend new users to use the Loctite at first, you can use it after you have much background.

※ Loctite prevents the nut from loosening, but it is not essential, as it can be tightened only when looseness is noticed.
